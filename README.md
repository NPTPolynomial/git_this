# git_this
Quickly git your changes up. Automatically Pull, Commit, and Push all in one command.

Reason for this:
**I noticed one always has to pull changes before pushing new changes up... so I thought, since you "ALWAYS" have to do it, why is it not automatic?**


How To Use:

When you have your git repository cloned into a folder, copy the git_this.sh into that folder.

then run:

<code>bash git_this.sh "commit message here"</code>

This will:

1. Pull previous changes from remote to your local branch
2. Commits your current changes
3. If no problems, push everything up.
4. Done!
